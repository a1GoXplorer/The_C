I'm going through various languages to get a feel for the differences.  C is a language which stands as a cold, dark monolith on the horizon of my programming travels.  I set forth with my trusty two hands, a book written by two gentlemen from the ancient-famous Bell Laboratories, and a feeling of respect for those who wrote coding languages in a time when computers weren't used by the majority of humanity.  I know that many of our modern languages take C's syntax.  I've heard developers say "C is the machine overlord".  If this has any truth to it I should learn C as a part of a robust training regime to become a great programmer.
